## AI Summarization Process

### **Categories**
The API generates summaries for the following categories:
1. **Financial Performance** - Insights into the companyâ€™s financial achievements and metrics.
2. **Market Dynamics** - Observations on market trends, competition, and positioning.
3. **Expansion Plans** - Information about future plans for growth and expansion.
4. **Environmental Risks** - Potential environmental challenges impacting operations.
5. **Regulatory or Policy Changes** - Legal or policy changes affecting the company.

### **AI Prompting**
For each category, the API constructs a custom prompt:
```
Summarize the following transcript for the category '<CATEGORY>': <TRANSCRIPT_TEXT>
```
The Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model generates the summary.

---

## Deployment and API Key Management

### **Environment Variable**
The AI model requires an API key, which should be securely stored as an environment variable:
```
GENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```
Make sure to set the environment variable in your deployment environment.

---

## Limitations
- **Text Length**: The API supports transcript text up to 20,000 tokens. Requests exceeding this limit will return an error.
- **Categories**: Summarization is limited to the predefined categories.
